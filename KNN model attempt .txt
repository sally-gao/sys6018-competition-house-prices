In addition to the support vector machine model, we also investigated KNN methods which yielded inferior results.
Using the ‘FNN’ package, we tested a variety of variable combinations and neighborhoods sizes. 
The most predictive model on the training data yielded a Kaggle score of .17875 when ran on the test data.
One difficulty of using KNN methods on this data set that we encountered was the high dimensionality of the data relative to the number of observations.
